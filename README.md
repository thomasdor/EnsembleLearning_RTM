# EnsembleLearning

In this Gitthub, you can find our project homework for Ensemble Learning (Michaël Allouche, Raphaël Attali, Thomas Dorveaux.)

The Data are stored in the folder Data.
The python file "template_script_V2.py" contains the final code. It should run fine; there is only need to change the path to load the initial data.

The jupyter file (EnsembleLearning_Project(1).ipynb) contains our original code; we translated it into the python file "template_script_V2.py" to respect the format asked for the project.

Finally,Submision_FinalFeaturesMapsExtractor.ipynb is the jupyter file we used to process the image and train a ResNet50 on it.

The images.zip is the file where the images are stored.
